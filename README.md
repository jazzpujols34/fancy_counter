# Fancy Counter

Fancy Counter is a simple Python application that uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface. The application displays a counter that can be incremented or decremented using buttons. The background color of the application changes based on the current count, with a gradient effect from white to red for positive counts and white to green for negative counts. An emoji is also displayed, which changes from a smiley face to a sad face depending on whether the count was last incremented or decremented.

## Features

- Increment and decrement the counter with buttons
- Background color changes based on the current count
- Emoji changes based on the last operation

## Dynamic Color Change

One of the key features of Fancy Counter is its dynamic color change. The background color of the application changes based on the current count, with a gradient effect from white to red for positive counts and white to green for negative counts. The color becomes darker as the absolute value of the count increases, reaching maximum darkness at a count of 100 or -100. This provides a visual indication of the count and adds a fun and engaging element to the application.
 
## Usage

```bash
